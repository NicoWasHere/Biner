# Biner
A tool to help clean up filesystems by speeding up the process of judging each file.

This program was created to act as a more efficient solution to cleaning up messy file systems.
The program uses a UX design simlar to that of the dating app tinder.
Biner will display every single file giving it a quick preview for the user to make a judgement of
When the right arrow is pressed it keeps the files and when left is pressed it deletes it.

All deleted files are stored in /Users/:yourName:/Library/Biner/trash until they are permanently deleted


This project was made in Node.js and built on the electron framework.
Currently only a MacOs version of it exists but a windows installer is coming soon!
